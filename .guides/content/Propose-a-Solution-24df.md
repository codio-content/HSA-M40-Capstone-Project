Once you’ve identified a problem to solve, your team will need to brainstorm ways this problem can be solved through the creation of a software artifact.

You can sketch out your preliminary thoughts in Flode, tinker with Python, and sketch your ideas on paper.  Once you have an idea in mind of what you’re trying to create, you will need to divvy up the work and set a timeline.  Your teacher will have an ultimate deadline by which all final products must be completed.

## Your submission for this assignment is a written proposal which is to include
1. A description of the problem to be solved
1. A description of your proposed solution
1. A list of distinct roles for each team member
1. A timeline including dates for implementation, revision, and release.

# 3A-A-2-1 Design and develop a software artifact working in a team.

## Team Roles
You might suggest student roles, or you could encourage students to research roles that are used in the software development industry.  Common roles are project manager, software developer, and quality assurance manager. 

## Timeline
Students will **always** need more time than they think to develop a prototype.  Products are **never** finished.  Setting hard deadlines helps keep projects like these on track.  Calling meetings with the project managers each day is a great way to ensure that projects are on track.
