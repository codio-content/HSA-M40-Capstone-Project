# You did it!
You identified a problem, brainstormed solutions, created a prototype, revised it based on feedback, and brought it to market.  This process is happening around you all the time.  Every app in the Google Play and Apple Store went through a similar process.  Every website that you visit is a result of a process like the one you just completed.

Modern software is rarely created in isolation.  Teams of individuals collaborate, bringing diverse backgrounds, talents and perspectives together.  Prototypes undergo many cycles of creation and revision before products go to market.  Many websites conduct [A/B testing](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/) to see which minor revision yields better results, essentially conducting on-the-fly research on live end-users.

## Each member of your team will need to write a reflection document.

In terms of the process, respond to the question, “How did your team leverage the diverse backgrounds, talents, and abilities of your team members to create a quality product?”

In terms of the product, respond to the question, “Describe ways that your product was improved through having people with different backgrounds contribute during the development and revision.”

### Your submission for this assignment should be submitted to your teacher.
