You and your team have worked hard to design, test, and improve your product.  It’s your intellectual property, and as such your team can decide how others may use it.

Several models exist for licensing software.  Research the possibilities (including [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware), [shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware), the various [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses, and the ways you can retain your rights through copyright.
Discuss the benefits and drawbacks to each licensing option and make a decision as a team how you will license your product.

## Software Licensing
There is no right or wrong answer to this question as long as the students justify their selection with factual statements about their selected licensing scheme.  Some students will wish to retain their rights to sell the product for profit.  Others will want to give away the product so it can reach as many users as possible.  Both of these are valid stances.
