It’s now time to execute your plan!  Working in your roles, create a **prototype** for the solution which addresses your selected product.  Your prototype should make use of some form of mathematical techniques or concepts.  At their core, computers are just really fast calculators.

Once you begin coding it’s often quite easy to lose track of the goal.  Reflect back often on the problem you are trying to solve and ask, “Does this solve the problem?”

A prototype does not have to be a finished product. It just needs to demonstrate that your idea is **viable**.  Reflect back often on your sketches and notes.  Once you realize that your original idea requires modification, discuss this with your team and make the necessary changes to the design.

## Your submission for this assignment is a functioning prototype and write-up including

1. The source code for the prototype
1. Annotated screenshots documenting which aspects of your original solution are working
1. A description of the aspects of your original solution which are not working/implemented
1. An explanation of which mathematical concepts your prototype relies on
1. A list of changes your team made from your original plan and why

# 3A-A-2-1 Design and develop a software artifact working in a team.
# 3A-A-5-6 Integrate grade-level appropriate mathematical techniques, concepts, and processes in the creation of computing artifacts.

## Team Roles
In the product development phase it is common for students in non-coding roles to say, “That’s not my job.”  Encourage students in quality assurance roles to [Pair Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxToW3ixrwo) with the software developer.  Product managers should be looking ahead and gathering resources needed for next steps so the entire team is supported.

## Timeline
Students will **always** need more time than they think to develop a prototype.  Products are **never** finished.  Setting hard deadlines helps keep projects like these on track.  Calling meetings with the project managers each day is a great way to ensure that projects are on track.
