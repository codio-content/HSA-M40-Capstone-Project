In this phase your team will implement a minimum of three improvements to your product with the goal of creating a finished product that solves the original problem as identified in the proposal.

As you work, be sure to document the changes that you have made, attributing those changes to the revision plan and the feedback data received.

## Your submission for this assignment is to include
1. The source code for the revised product
1. Annotated screenshots documenting which improvements have been implemented
1. A description of which planned improvements are not working/implemented
1. A list of at least two improvements that could be made with additional time

# 3A-I-6-29 Redesign user interfaces (e.g., webpages, mobile applications, animations) to be more inclusive, accessible, and minimizing the impact of the designer's inherent bias.

# 3A-A-2-1 Design and develop a software artifact working in a team.

## Final Product
Student projects are “never finished.”  Teams which claim to be finished early can always be motivated to incorporate additional functionalities and behaviors.  They can always go through additional user testing and feedback cycles.  Teams often feel like their final product is not finished even when the deadline has arrived.  Those teams should simply list their unfinished features in the submission’s section for future improvements.
