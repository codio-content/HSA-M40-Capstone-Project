Once you have a functioning prototype it’s time to let others try it out.  Often times things that make sense to the people who design and build a system turn out to be confusing for end-users.  Other times users interact with systems in ways never expected by the designers.

Begin by designing a survey instrument to collect feedback on your prototype.  Your team should determine the criteria against which your prototype should be measured.  You can use an online tool like [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/), or you can collect and collate the feedback on paper.  Regardless, you will need to collect both quantitative data (numbers) and qualitative data (descriptions) that will guide your team in your efforts to revise your prototype into a final product.

## Your submission for this assignment is to include
1. Your survey instrument
1. The raw feedback data you collected
1. A summary of what your team learned through collection and analysis of the data
1. A revision plan to include a minimum of three changes based on feedback

# 3A-C-7-13 Develop and apply criteria for evaluating a computer system for a given purpose.

## Quantitative Data
Students can easily create a survey using a [likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) to measure agreement to statements such as, “This was easy to use,” or “I found this helpful” in the context of the original problem statement.

## Qualitative Data
Students can collect qualitative data in several ways.  For instance, they can observe people using their prototype and take notes indicating when users became confused or frustrated.  Students can also interview users after they have tried out the prototype, seeking common themes across several users.
